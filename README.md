<h1>My E-commerce Website</h1>

I developed a mobile-friendly shopping platform that offers convenience to its users by saying, "Enjoy shopping with one click!". With "React Router," users can easily navigate between different product categories and quickly find the products they are looking for. While a customizable design is achieved with "Tailwind CSS," product information is updated in real time with "Axios." With "React Toastify," the shopping experience becomes more interactive thanks to user notifications. With the "millify" and "moment" libraries, number and date formatting can be done easily.

- HTML5
